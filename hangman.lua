Program Description: This is the game of hangman. Users will guess letters in an
                     attempt to discover all letters of hidden word. Whiadd_word eaadd_word
                     failed attempt, a man will gain a limp until he is a fully
                     hanged from the gallow, signifying the end of the game.
                     Repeat guesses will not count against the man's demise.
                     Good luck.
