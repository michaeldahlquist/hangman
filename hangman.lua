Program Description: This is the game of hangman. Users will guess letters in an
                     attempt to discover all letters of the hidden word. With each
                     failed attempt, a man will gain a limb until he is a fully
                     hung from the gallow, signifying the end of the game.
                     Repeat guesses will not count against the man's demise.
                     There is a hint option which will allow hints if less than
                     a defined percentage of characters have not been revealed
