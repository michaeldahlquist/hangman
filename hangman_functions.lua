Program Description: These are the functions for the game of hangman.
                     This file is ran at the beginning of "hangman.lua" to
                     define all of the functions. Each function is further
                     described within itself.

function get_lines(file_name)
--A portion of this code was inspired by:
--https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11201262/how-to-read-data-from-a-file-in-lua
--get_lines(file_name) returns a table and count of all the lines in file_name
--does not include return characters
    new_table = {}
    count = 0
    local file = io.open(file_name, "rb")
    for line in io.lines(file_name) do

        new_table[count] = string.sub(line, 1, string.len(line)-1)
    end
    file:close()
    return new_table
end

function table_size(this_table)
--this function was found at the following url:
--https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-the-number-of-elements-in-an-array-with-Lua
--table_size returns the count of all of the items in thisTable
    counter = 0
    for each in pairs(this_table) do
        counter = counter+1

--as well as the gallow. It is updated as the user makes incorrect guesses

function hangman (words)
--This function plays the entrie game of hangman. It take in one parameter
--that is a table of words, indexed 1 through n number of words. A random
--word is selected and the user must guess the letters in the words, losing
--at the sixth incorrect guess. This function returns two boolean values,
--whether the user wants to play_again, or if the game_won.

    --START THE GAME OF HANGMAN:

    --calculate size of table
    words_length = table_size(words)

    --This section finds a random index of the table, meaning the word is randomly picked.
    math.randomseed(os.time()) --need to run first
    random_index = math.random(1,words_length)
    word = words[random_index]
    word_length = string.len( word )

    --Empty table that will store the users guesses.
    letters_guessed = {}

    wrong_ct = 0 --number of times user guessed wrong
    correct_ct = 0--number of times user guessed correctly
    word = words[random_index]

    --This initializes each letter of the word to false as a way to test if the
    --user inputs a correct letter later in the code.
    show_letter = {} --better name for this variable??
    for i = 1, word_length do --this initalized them to false
